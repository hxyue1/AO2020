# AO2020

This repository contains code and data to generate predictions for the 2020 Australian Open. The main code source is in the notebook a-priori-final.ipynb.
I've also included a dummy submission file of my own creation based on the 2020 draw, and my final predictions are found in AO predictions.csv.

This work is an extension of Betfair's 2019 AO Datathon to the 2020. The ATP match level data is obtained from Skoval's Deuce package which scrapes data from Jeff Sackman's repo.
Show them some love: https://github.com/skoval/deuce, https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp.

Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Betfair, I don't endorse gambling, but if you do choose to gamble based on my predictions, I'm not responsible for any gains or losses you may make, you are.
