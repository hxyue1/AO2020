# AO2020

This repository contains code and data to generate predictions for the 2020 Australian Open. The main code source is in the notebook a-priori-final.ipynb.
I've also included a dummy submission file of my own creation based on the 2020 draw, and my final predictions are found in AO predictions.csv. I've also written a Medium article on my work which you check out here: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/australian-open-2020-predicting-atp-match-outcomes-7f5fbba62122.

At the conclusion of the tournament I intend to write a review, there will be additional notebooks posted so stay tuned for that!

This work is an extension of Betfair's 2019 AO Datathon to the 2020. My code isn't original work but a modification of Qile Tan's notebook which you can find here https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/aus-open-datathon/blob/master/python-machine-learning-walkthrough.ipynb. The ATP match level data is obtained from Skoval's Deuce package which scrapes data from Jeff Sackman's repo.
Show them some love: https://github.com/skoval/deuce, https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp.

Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by Betfair, I don't endorse gambling, but if you do choose to gamble based on my predictions, I'm not responsible for any gains or losses you may make, you are.
